    <h1>We have a big problem</h1>
    <h2>ETHS has set Chrome's policy for student Chromebooks to block anything that is a local file from using Javascript. You might be wondering, what does JavaScript do? Every well-made website relies on JavaScript, Javascript powers games, pop-ups, everything Google, and just about everything else. The policy is only allowing HTML and CSS content to load, which is purely visuals, and does not allow for any sort of scripting.</h2>

    <h2>I'll do mmy best to find a way to circumvent this but for now, WOW/SuperSearcher is kinda cooked. :(</h2>
